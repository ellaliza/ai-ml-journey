# AI/ML Learning Journey ðŸš€

Hi! I'm currently on a journey to become an AI/ML Engineer. 
I have done some extensive research, taken a look at a couple of roadmaps, and other resources for getting started with Machine Learning and have decided to make my own roadmap. My journey is in two pases for now.


Phase One is about laying the foundations, making my way around and getting used to the essential python libraries. Since I am already very familiar with the basics of programming, I will skip that part. As I learn new things, I will come up with projects to practice what I have learnt. 

## ðŸ“š Phase One â€“ Foundations
- [x] Numpy
- [x] SQL
- [x] Matplotlib
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] Scipy
- [ ] Mathematical Foundations

This repo documents my hands-on practice and mini-projects.
